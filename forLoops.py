# an exercise in Python for loops

# this code loops over numbers 1 through 10 and prints them to the screen

for i in range(1, 11):      # uses variable i to loop over ranges 1-11, starting at 1 and stopping at 11
    print(i)                # prints current value of i variable

# Output: integers 1 through 10
